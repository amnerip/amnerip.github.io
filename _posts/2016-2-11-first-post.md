As an act of anxious procastination, I decided to set up the bare bones of a
simple website. In here I hope to blog about learning experiences, thoughts
about the state of my world, reflections on my past, or more light-hearted
things. I would ideally reflect on some of the projects I worked on or classes I
took.

### A reason for doing this...

I once set up a wordpress blog to document future projects and such. I didn't
end up using this as much, and I also felt like there was too little content to
warrant the overhead behind the system running it. It wasn't slow in performace.
It's not that type of overhead.

Before, I knew little to nothing about writing web sites (this was the end of my
        freshman year). Now I see that the system I want to run behind the
static information I want to share is not Wordpress, but rather something more
simple.

Ideally I want to be able to get to a point were I wean this site off libraries
or services that I myself haven't written. This would help me learn more about
how the system works from the server to the actual content displayed in the
browser. I awknowledge that this requires both time and money (servers or
domain names are not yet free), so I guess this means that I have another
project to add to the to-do list...
