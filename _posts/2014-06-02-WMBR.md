On my free time, I volunteer at MIT's radio station. These are the shows I have
participated in or hosted.

## 2014 Summer Season
After this I chose an early retirement...

### Paisanos en un Mundo Extraño (co-host: Andres Perez):
A show that plays music by Hispanic artists or songs written in Spanish. Running
this program was helpful in maintaining my fluency in Spanish, and to expose
myself to poetry and literature. A poet I found I really liked was
[Cesar Vallejo](http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/c%C3%A9sar-vallejo)

We also played out skits that included a couple of our friends or shared current
news.

### Excommunicated by the Catholic Church (co-host: Elizabeth N Rider):
Every week we tried to find new artists we could share with others. It was an hour devoted to music.
