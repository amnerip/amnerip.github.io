During the 2014 summer I worked at the Edgerton Center. The center was started
in the name of Harold "Doc" Edgerton, an engineer who further developed the
field of photography through his work in stroboscopic photography, and who
encouraged his students to learn about engineering through a hands-on approach.

A part of the center is its K-12 outreach among the local Cambridge and Boston
students. During the summer, the center hosts several summer programs and also
assists other MIT departments' programs. The main focus of these programs are
engineering and science topics such as mechanical engineering, electrical
engineering, chemistry, biology, and optics.

As a summer worker, I was dealing with a variety of tasks.
Mainly, I interacted with the students and helped them on a one-on-one basis
whenever they needed help with the activities. The students ranged in age from
incoming middle school students to incoming high school students.

Behind the scenes, there was also database management; the student's data was
placed into a FileMaker database in order to easily manage name tags, forms,
and handouts. Different activities required different amount of preparing. For
example, an activity where students learn about the different states of matter
through making lip balm had a certain "recipe" that was taught to the students.
In past years, this recipe had been a difficult one because the final result
had caused the solid wax and butter to separate from the oil and pigment, or
for the final color to be dull, unlike what the original pigment looked like.
The preparation involved testing to see which ingredients were problematic and
to find better methods to prevent the dull color or separation. During the
different summer programs, I was also asked to photograph the
activities.

Some activities taught during the summer aren't offered during the year. These
usually have a large time requirement or are easier to teach to small groups,
such as glass fusing, the Traffic Light Activity, and Techno Threads, an
activity where students learn about circuits by sewing LEDs unto their
clothing or apparel. This summer included a new two-week program that
meant making an [underwater glider]({% post_url 2014-8-12-Seaglide %}).

Coming into MIT, I had very little knowledge regarding the field of electrical
engineering and computer science. I was forced to grow faster than I had ever
grown before in my knowledge of math and science during my first year at MIT.
My time at the Edgerton Center meant reinforcing what I had learned; teaching
other students the basics of the concepts I had learned in the past year and
fixing their mistakes allowed me to gain an intuition for those concepts. For
example, a common lesson taught during the school year at Edgerton included a
simple circuit with an LED, a battery, a switch, and a resistor. The amount and
variety of mistakes that a 10 year old can make trying to put the circuit
together is more than I had previously imagined. It
required me to see the circuit from the child's perspective and reword what I
knew from classes like 6.01 (Introduction to EECS 1) and 8.02 (Electricity and
Magnetism) so that I could explain to the student in his words what and why
things had gone wrong.
