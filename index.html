 <p>I graduated from MIT in 2017, where I studied Computer Science and Engineering. Most recently I was at Meta from 2017-2023, where I focused on automation, tooling, and PRE of both backend storage infrastructure as well as messenger.com’s infrastructure. </p> 
  <p>I’m fascinated by systems — human, computer, financial — and how they interact with each other. This is what ultimately led me down the computer science path and later on embracing the Production Engineering role. The more I learn the more intimidating these systems become, as there’s so many contradictions and feedback loops that make me think “how the eff is anything still functioning?”. I focus on SRE/PE types of work, with a heavy dose of pragmatism, always considering a project or goals’s business impact, engineering culture impact, as well as technical impact. My experience has ranged from developing bespoke automation, scaling up and scaling down storage systems, to improving the observability maturity for large scale systems.</p>
