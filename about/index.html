<p>My name is Ana Neri. I was raised in Southern California to modest Mexican
parents. From California I went to MIT to study Computer Science; I belong to
the class of 2017. </p>
<p>This site is my personal blog; my thoughts, projects, experiences. Some
posts are meant as reminders for things I don't do very often. As a disclaimer,
These writings reflect my own opinions and no one else's. </p>
